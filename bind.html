          <p>
            Bind is a map with two Spike sites. The first, in A, is an open area, protected by many wooden boxes and a
            high window, suitable for defense with snipers. The second, in B, is located under a metal tunnel, and is
            not easy to reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its particularity lies in its teleporters, which allow anyone to cross the map back and forth and try to
            take their opponent by surprise. However, teleporters are very noisy and it's quite easy to punish the ones
            who take them whether to attack or defend.

            These are the basic callouts that you should know when it comes to the A Site in Bind. You can also be more
            specific by
            adding more precise words such as “back truck,” “inside lamps,” “close triple”, among other things.

            These are the basic callouts that you have to know when you’re playing on Bind’s B site. These are standard
            callouts that should easily be understood by anyone who has played the game for a decent amount of time.
